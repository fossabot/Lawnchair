Lawnchair is a free, open source launcher aiming at bringing Pixel Launcher features to other devices. 

## Now what does this cost?

Nothing, I am promising that Lawnchair, including all it's features, will always be free! But if you really like it, you can still pay me a beer or something on [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=E2EFKTUC62KDQ).

## How to Contribute?

Contributing to Lawnchair is pretty straight forward! Fork the project, clone your fork and start coding!

Before implementing any new big features I would be happy if you would either hit me up in an issue, or on [Telegram](https://t.me/deletescape). I probably won't reject it, but this is just to make sure that you don't invest your time for something I won't include.
